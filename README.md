# Automate-SPM_TMS-Project
This is a project I made to automate data analysis for efficiency and accuracy --to avoid human error.
Feel free to use this code in your lab, just make sure to change the input data for subjects and sessions depending on your study and lab.
Also make sure to change the destDir and dataDir --directories for the data (i.e., fMRI scans) and the output directories to fit yuor lab and layout of your data
A script to automate preprocessing, GLM Model analysis, multiple condition matfile creation, movement regressor formatting and extrapolation, and second-level model group-level analysis on the Statistical Parametric Modulating software (SPM)
